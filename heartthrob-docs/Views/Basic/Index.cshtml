<h1><i class="far fa-star"></i> heartthrob: the css + js framework</h1>
<p>
    The heartthrob framework can add more elegancy to your project, to looks like the
    Microsoft Fluent Design design, it was also inspired by <a href="https://www.michaelwe.st/fluent-kit/">Michael West</a> - an incredible designer who will
    dominate the world with his ideas.
</p>
<p>
    Built, since 2016, from scrath with bare CSS - and JavaScript, it uses the grid system for responsive websites
    based in Bootstrap 3, the idea is to have a start for when you need to develop a solution for your company or
    for yourself, it's clean, simple, easy and still small.
</p>
<p>
    The ideia behind this project is to make it as simple as possible for new developers, and agencys that creates several websites a month, by making it simple to study, contribute and modify.
    It also does a lot of automatic functions without you needing to spend too much time in it.

        <h3><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> perfect for dashboards</h3>
        <p>
            I built and use heartthrob in several dashboards and CMSs in several startups and corporate
            systems.
        </p>
        <p>More to share about this soon.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3><i class="fab fa-bootstrap"></i> bootstrap grid system</h3>
        <p>
            One of the key points of heartthrob is using the same bootstrap grid, with a tool that you
            have more control.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also has a lot of compatibility with any website using bootstrap since we used a lot of
            similiar classes names.
        </p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-user-ninja"></i> kendo ui compatibility</h3>
        <p>
            Inside heartthrob you will find a kendo.heartthrob css file, that can add all the work made
            in this framework to the kendo interface. This looks pretty good for grids, dropdowns,
            scheduler and other inputs.

<h2><i class="fas fa-cloud-download-alt"></i> how to download it</h2>
<p>Ok, enough talk about the project, how do you use it? First download it to your project using one of this options: </p>

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/heartthrob" target="_blank" class="btn btn-link"><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Download with npm</a><br />
<a href="https://github.com/vtnorton/Heartthrob/releases" target="_blank" class="btn btn-link"><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Download in GitHub Releases</a><br />

<p>We use continous delivery to make the latest version available to all of the options above, this is one of the reasons for not having direct download links here, since we build almost one version a week. I'm working on bringing other options for you to use it.</p>

<div class="space-low"></div>
<h2><i class="fas fa-box-open"></i> how to install it</h2>

<p>To install the basics you will need to import the css file and the JavaScript file. Some - a lot - functions need jQuery to work, but if you are interested only on the css you should be fine without importing it too.</p>
<pre><code class="highlight language-html">
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;./heartthrob/css/heartthrob.css&quot; /&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.1.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;./heartthrob/js/heartthrob.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                </code></pre>

<br />
<p>If you don't want to use the minified version, than use this: </p>
<pre><code class="highlight language-html">
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;./heartthrob/css/heartthrob.min.css&quot; /&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.1.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;./heartthrob/js/heartthrob.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                </code></pre>

<br />
<p>If you want to use the kendo compatibility function, and make your kendo ui incredible beautiful then you will need to import this other file:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight language-html">
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;./heartthrob/css/kendo.heartthrob.css&quot; /&gt;
                </code></pre>

<br />
<p>If you don't want to use the minified version, than use this: </p>
<pre><code class="highlight language-html">
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;./heartthrob/css/kendo.heartthrob.min.css&quot; /&gt;
                </code></pre>

<h2><i class="fab fa-github"></i> contribute: let's build it together</h2>
<p>
    I [<a href="https://vtnorton.com">the author</a>] and my team are using it in the solutions we build every single day, so expect nice fixes
    and small additions as it will be more and more compatible with Kendo and other browsers.
</p>

<p>I'm more than open to have contributions to this project, so go to the GitHub page to help me make it even better!</p>
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/vtnorton/Heartthrob" class="btn btn-link" style="display:inline"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> heartthrob</a><br />
<a href="https://github.com/vtnorton/Heartthrob-docs" class="btn btn-link"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> heartthrob-docs</a>
<br />
<p>We use continous deployment/delivery to share the latest bits to you, so we ship fixes and new features as PATCH versions 1.1.XX, if we change anything that will require you to update your code than we will update the MINOR version with a blog post on what it had changed.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i> project roadmap</h3>
<p>I'm sharing with some some of my plans to move foward with heartthrob as I'm focused on: </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> I want to make it more accessible for every person in the world and make it easy for developers to create accessible websites.</li>
    <li><strong>Kendo UI compatibility:</strong> A lot of work to make a full compatibility with kendo is needed - including for different browsers. Also I'm focused on simplifing the kendo.heartthrob.css file.</li>
</ul>
<p>I welcome contributions of all kinds from the community, but especially those that support the efforts above.</p>
