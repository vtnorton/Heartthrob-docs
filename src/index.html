            <h1>heartthrob: the basics</h1>
            <p>The heartthrob framework (heartthrob.css) can add more elegancy to your project, here you will find the basic stuff from this ultimate framework.</p>

            <div class="space-medium"></div>

            <h2>overview + contribute</h2>
            <p>Heartthrob is a framework made to looks like the Windows design, that I'm building for at least 2 years, following the Microsoft Fluent Design, it was also inspired by <a href="https://www.michaelwe.st/fluent-kit/">Michael West</a> - an incredible designer who will dominate the world with his ideas. </p>
            <p>Build from scrath with bare CSS - and JavaScript, it uses the grid system for responsive websites based in Bootstrap 3, the idea is to have a start for when you need to develop a solution for your company or for yourself, it's clean, simple, easy and still small. One of the biggest features in heartthrob is the compatibility with Kendo UI.</p>
            <br />
			<p>I'm [<a href="https://vtnorton.com">the author</a>] using it in the solutions I build everyday, over the next months the idea is to get it out of a '#conceptual project' to go all real! So expect nice fixes and small additions as it will be more and more compatible with Kendo and other browsers. I will also work to make this documentation better and adding a bunch of stuff here.</p>

            <div class="space-medium"></div>
            <h3>let's build it together</h3>
            <p>I'm more than open to have contributions to this project, so go to the GitHub page to help me make it even better!</p>
            <br />
            <a href="https://github.com/vtnorton/Heartthrob" class="btn btn-link" style="display:inline"><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> heartthrob</a><br />

            <div class="space-medium"></div>
            <h3>how to contribute</h3>
            <p>Here is a quicky guide in how to contribute to the framework:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Clone <a href="https://github.com/vtnorton/Heartthrob">the project from GitHub</a>.</li>
                <li>Use npm install to install all dependencies</li>
                <li>Use any editor you want to make any changes inside /src</li>
                <li>Once is finished and you want to build what you created, just run the command: "gulp build", and a folder /build will apper, use that folder to implement across your system.</li>
            </ol>

            <br />
            <p>And now here is a quicky guide in how to contribute to the <strong>documentation</strong> (we are not attached to this code, so feel free to change whatever you want in the documentation, and I agree with you, it's a mess the code!):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Clone <a href="https://github.com/vtnorton/Heartthrob-docs">the project from GitHub</a>.</li>
                <li>Use Visual Studio 2017 or 2019, with AspNet Core, to change and build it.</li>
            </ol>


            <div class="space-medium"></div>
            <h3>don't code? Still want to contribute!?</h3>
            <p>Here is a few things you can do - almost in every open source project - that would help it be even better:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Found something cool on the internet that you want to be added here? <a href="https://github.com/vtnorton/Heartthrob/issues">Tell me!</a></li>
                <li>Found a bug, please <a href="https://github.com/vtnorton/Heartthrob/issues">report</a>! Will fix it ASAP - <i>this is actually the code my team uses every single day.</i></li>
                <li>This documentation can be improved somehow? <a href="https://github.com/vtnorton/Heartthrob/issues">Just say it to me</a> and will do my best!</li>
                <li>Something is missing, in the documentation, the repository, or in your life? <a href="https://github.com/vtnorton/Heartthrob/issues">You will be heard!</a></li>
                <li>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/vt_norton">@vt_norton</a> and in my <a href="https://vtnorton.com/blog">blog</a> to have info about updates!</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="space-medium"></div>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This documentation isn't complete yet with all functions that importing heartthrob to your project will get. Working on it!</p>

            <div class="space-medium"></div>
            <h2>how to install</h2>
            <p>Ok, enough talk about the project, how do you use it?  Simple, you can get it with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/heartthrob">npm</a>. Simple as that.</p>
            <br />
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/heartthrob" class="btn btn-link" style="display:inline"><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Download with npm</a><br />
            <br />
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For now npm is the only method available in case you don't want to clone the repository and copy the files from there. Will make it available in more areas as I'm investing in some continous integration for this thing, will let you know later in a <a href="https://vtnorton.com/blog">blog</a> post.</p>
